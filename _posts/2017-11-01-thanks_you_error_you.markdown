When we first start coding and we get an error some of us freak out.  We take it as a personal affront to our ability to be a great programmer, intelligent, and to learn.  We curse those errors.  Then we fix one error just to get another one and we lose our minds.  I am learning that errors are just wonderful hints to help us get our code to work.  They have a ton of hidden information that help us.  So lets grab our Sherlock Homes pipe or Nancy Drew outfits and look at some errors. 
1. A Name Error= Happens when you have undefined bare words.  So a given name is invalid or undefined. 
2. A Syntax Error= When you have non-sensical code.  So when you have ruby code with an invalid syntax. 
3. Type Error=Objects of the wrong type mixed together.  So when you encounter an object that is not of the expected type.
4. Division Error=when you try dividing by zero.  So the computer cannot computer a number divided by zero.
When you read an error it will tell you four important things: 
1. file location
2. line number where the error occurs(helpful in long lines of code)
3. what the scope of the problem is
4. what and why you have an error
You can run a specific Ruby file by typing ruby lib/name of file.rb
If you get an error you want to examine the error for the four clues (file location, line number, scope of problem, and the what/why)
Then do into the program file and examine the code especially the line of code your error message directed you to. 
What do you need to do to fix it depending on if you have a Name, Syntax, Type, or Division error?  
Then you fix it.  
If your hypothesis for a solution doesn't work you try out other hypotheisis.  
If you still can't get the answer go to the question board and ask for help before you get frustrated.  
Once you fix all of your errors by focusing on one at a time you will make sure you learn submit so Git Hub can push it through.  
Some big issues I have found are:
1. forgetting to save your file (look for the blue circle at the top right of your screen bc blue circle is not saved)
2. forgetting to learn submit when you finish
3. having punctuation or spacing errors
4. having extra symbols around
5. not refreshing your page after learn submit
6. not reading the error codes carefully enough
7. trying to solve more then one problem at a time 
So love up on those Error Codes because they are your best coding clues and the easiest way to track down what you need to fix to make your awesome code work smoothly.

Ask any kindergarten class and you will find at least one kid that wants to be a fireman, cop, princess, or marine biologist.  When we are young these careers sound so cool.  You believe that one day you will be hanging out on a boat with Jacques Cousteau and you will be constantly in the water discovering new sea life.  However, the truth is my job requires constant travel.  I live on a hundred-acre farm in Tennessee and I have only been home for a total combined day of about one month. So, I have been traveling for 9 months.  It is challenging to have a pet or go out on a date or even just take a real long bath.  
I am bored to death.  There are times when I do see something cool like a humpback whale or a Dumbo octopus but mostly I just spend all day staring at the water.  I am not allowed in the water very often and most of the time I spend my entire vacation swimming or snorkeling.  My job is so easy.  I rarely learn anything new.  

On my last vacation in Mexico I was snorkeling and loving life.  I sat down at a little cafe and just people watched.  I thought why can't I find a job where I can snorkel then work from a cool place like this coffee shop?  I started thinking and I started asking people questions.  The happiest people with the most freedom and who loved their work were the computer people.  

Then I began researching because that is something I like to do as a scientist.  I found UX design first.  Which is very cool.  Making things work better for the user.  Many of us have been on websites that we thought man this could work a lot better.  Many of us have played games and thought I could improve this game so much.  Then UI design came up.  I paint and sew in my free time, so I love art.  Anything where you get to create and make something beautiful I really enjoy.  Then I start seeing full stack and I am like well what is that?  And I go down the wormhole of possibilities.  What do I decide?  I decide I want to do it all.  

A career where you never stop learning and are rarely board because you are busy problem solving and creating.  Sign me up.  

I start looking at schools.  There are many choices there.  I check out bachelor’s degree programs.  I check out online vs at a physical location.  I try out several free programs.  Then I set up a meeting with Courtney Morgan and she is so kind and helpful that I jump right in.  

I grew up with a single mom who I saw work herself to exhaustion because she didn't have the education to do the jobs she was meant for.  I worked on and off campus, played varsity basketball, and did community service to graduate with my Bachelor’s degree in Biology.  It has taken me very far and I am grateful for everything that I have done in my life.  

I am ready for a new chapter.  I am ready to evolve endlessly the way computer programming is always changing.  I am ready to be a problem solver and creator.  I am grateful for Flatiron for the opportunity to become the person I want to be.

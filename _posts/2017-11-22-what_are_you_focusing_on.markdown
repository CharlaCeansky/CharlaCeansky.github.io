Strategy is something I have always loved.  Some of my favorite video games really make you think about how you are going to approach something then being ready to do a 90 degree or 180 degree turn at the last minute.  This is the same in our lives.  We read people.  You don't ask your boss for a raise when she is in a bad mood.  I really have been thinking alot about how different people are approaching this program.  

Advice I have recieved:  

1.  Talk out loud to yourself, your rubber duck, or your pets
2.  Practice everyday
3.  Be someone that others want to work/code/learn with
4.  Feed your portfolio and make it big and fat
5.  Do a killer job on all your projects
6.  Ask for help early on before you want to smash your computer
7.  BE PERSISTANT
8. Get good at reading and understanding your error messages
9.  GOOGLE IT 
10.  Be confidant
11.  Slow Progress is better then none. 

Things I have collected:
1.  Use your tools and know them well (ex. pry)
2.  Help others because you learn way more that way
3.  Practice using the coding words
4.  Ask questions even if you have to put them in chat
5.  It is great when you finish something to request a 1 on 1 to go over it and make sure you understand it
6.  LAUGH...laugh at yourself and your code and that tiny ? that was throwing everything off
7.  Don't focus on getting through the lab;  focus on understanding it
8.  Review review and review some more
9.  Review with other people
10.  Collaboration is where it is at
11.  Ignore rude people 
12.  Ask more questions

And most Importantly DON'T FOCUS ON THE MONEY OR TIME....FOCUS ON REALLY LEARNING.
